# The-Prevention-of-Drowsy-Driving-Fatalities-using-Mechatronics
Code for BCAMRL Research Project

Each year, drowsy driving causes an estimated 328,000 crashes, 109,000 injuries, and 6,400 fatalities. However, there are still no widespread measures being taken to prevent drowsy driving-related casualties. Though methods of preventing sleeping while driving have been researched in the past, none of them have been implemented on a large scale because an accurate and reliable sleep prevention device may cost a lot of money and take up a lot of space, which may become a detriment while driving. In this research, I introduce a new device which allows the detection of drowsy driving in a compact and cost-effective form factor, while also providing in-the-moment prevention measures. Through testing, it is clear that this device can accurately detect rotational acceleration and use this input to deliver a sharp noise and vibration to wake the user up. I expect this device to be easy-to-use and efficient, so that it can greatly reduce the amount of drowsy-driving fatalities and injuries around the world.
